# dl4kawaks

an ugly downloader for all roms and client of winkawaks, an arcade game simulater.

## why i use this instead of downloading directly from their website?

* because they dont offer an option for downloading all roms XD

## can i configure anything?

* if u use node, yes, a few to config in config.json

* if u use exe, nop. it will download to the same folder where the exe file is. thank u.

## it's so fucking slow

* yes. u can configure useAsync to `true` if u use node, can speed up a lot

* but if u use exe file, sry again, there is something wrong with pkg tool which i didnt figure out

* anyway u can leave it alone, no hurry right?

## can u do something/help me with

* nop. sry
